**Master's Project Description: Using Tableau to Identify Future Football Talents for West Ham United**

Congratulations on completing your Master's program in Business Analytics and securing a prestigious PhD offer at Liverpool University! As you embark on your academic journey, you have also taken on an exciting part-time role as a football scout for West Ham United. Your mission is to leverage your analytical skills and expertise to identify and recommend promising football talents for the club.

**Project Overview:**
The main objective of this project is to use Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to identify and visualize potential future talents for West Ham United. By combining your business analytics knowledge with your passion for football, you aim to support the club's talent scouting process and contribute to their success on the field.

**Project Details:**
1. **Data Collection and Preparation:** You begin by collecting data from various sources, including football databases, scouting reports, and performance statistics of potential talents. The data is then carefully curated and cleaned to ensure its accuracy and relevance for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilizing Tableau's interactive features, you conduct an exploratory analysis of the data. This includes examining the players' performance metrics, strengths, weaknesses, and historical records. By creating insightful visualizations, you aim to uncover hidden patterns and potential standout players.

3. **Feature Engineering:** To enhance the scouting process, you engineer new features that capture important attributes of players that may not be readily available in the raw data. These features could include metrics related to player potential, versatility, or leadership qualities.

4. **Machine Learning and Predictive Analysis:** Leveraging Tableau's advanced analytics capabilities, you integrate machine learning algorithms to predict the future potential of young footballers. The algorithms consider various factors, such as age, playing position, physical attributes, and past performance, to generate player rankings.

5. **Dashboard Development:** The heart of the project lies in creating an interactive and user-friendly dashboard using Tableau. The dashboard provides an overview of the talent pool, allows filtering based on specific criteria, and offers drill-down capabilities to explore individual player profiles in detail.

6. **Dynamic Visualization:** To ensure the dashboard remains stable and informative even if new data is added or existing data changes, you implement hyper parameters to dynamically adjust the visualizations and rankings.

**Impact and Value:**
By applying your skills in business analytics and data visualization to the world of football scouting, you contribute to West Ham United's scouting process, helping the club identify and nurture young talents who may shape the future of the team. Your work is invaluable in building a strong and competitive team for the club's long-term success.

**Conclusion:**
This project exemplifies the seamless integration of your academic background in Business Analytics and your passion for football. By utilizing Tableau's capabilities, you provide West Ham United with actionable insights and data-driven decisions that will have a positive impact on the club's future. Moreover, your continued pursuit of a PhD in Business Analytics promises even greater advancements in the field of sports analytics.
